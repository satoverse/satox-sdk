# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the satox-sdk.

## Components
- **Core Components**: Main functionality
- **Security Layer**: Security implementations
- **API Layer**: External interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Data management

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: For core services
- **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling

## Security Architecture
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Post-quantum security
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted data transmission
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

## Performance Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: Optimized data access
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage
- **Scalability**: Horizontal and vertical scaling

## Integration Points
- **External APIs**: Third-party integrations
- **Database Systems**: Data persistence
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and metrics

## ⚠️ Limitations

### **Blockchain Compatibility**

- **No Smart Contract Support:** Satox is based on Ravencoin and does **not** support smart contracts or EVM compatibility
- **Asset-Based:** Focuses on asset creation, management, and transfer rather than programmable contracts
- **UTXO Model:** Uses Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model like Bitcoin/Ravencoin, not account-based like Ethereum

### **Platform Support**

- **Desktop Focus:** Primarily designed for desktop/server environments
- **Mobile Limitations:** Mobile SDK provides limited functionality compared to core SDK
- **Browser Support:** WebAssembly bindings have performance limitations for complex operations

### **Network Requirements**

- **Internet Connection:** Requires active internet connection for blockchain operations
- **Node Synchronization:** Full node operations require significant storage and bandwidth
- **API Dependencies:** Some features depend on external API services

### **Development Considerations**

- **Learning Curve:** Ravencoin/UTXO model differs from Ethereum/smart contract development
- **Testing Environment:** Testnet required for development and testing
- **Asset Management:** Asset creation and management have specific requirements and limitations
