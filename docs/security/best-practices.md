# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for using Satox SDK.

## General Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
- Implement multiple layers of security
- Use both quantum-resistant and classical cryptography
- Apply security at application, network, and infrastructure levels

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant minimum necessary permissions
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regularly review and audit permissions

### Secure by Default
- Enable security features by default
- Use secure configurations out of the box
- Require explicit opt-out for less secure options

## Authentication Security

### Password Policies
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Implement password complexity requirements
- Regular password rotation
- Secure password storage with salting and hashing

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Enable MFA for all user accounts
- Use hardware tokens or authenticator apps
- Implement backup authentication methods

### Session Management
- Use secure session tokens
- Implement session timeout
- Secure session storage
- Logout functionality

## Key Management

### Key Generation
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Generate keys on secure hardware when possible
- Use appropriate key sizes for algorithms

### Key Storage
- Store private keys in hardware security modules (HSM)
- Encrypt keys at rest
- Implement key backup and recovery procedures
- Use secure key distribution methods

### Key Rotation
- Implement automatic key rotation
- Monitor key usage and access
- Have procedures for emergency key rotation
- Test key rotation procedures regularly

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use quantum-resistant encryption for long-term data
- Implement end-to-end encryption
- Use strong encryption algorithms and key sizes

### Data Classification
- Classify data by sensitivity level
- Apply appropriate security controls based on classification
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures

### Data Handling
- Minimize data collection and retention
- Implement secure data disposal procedures
- Use secure data transmission protocols
- Monitor data access and usage

## Network Security

### Communication Security
- Use TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Implement certificate pinning
- Use secure protocols (HTTPS, WSS, etc.)
- Validate certificates and connections

### Network Segmentation
- Segment networks based on security requirements
- Use firewalls and access controls
- Implement network monitoring and logging
- Regular network security assessments

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement output encoding
- Sanitize data before processing

### Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Implement proper error logging
- Use secure error handling practices
- Monitor for security-related errors

### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regular security code reviews
- Use static analysis tools
- Keep dependencies updated

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement intrusion detection systems
- Use security information and event management (SIEM)
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Audit Logging
- Log all security-relevant events
- Implement secure log storage
- Regular log review and analysis
- Protect log integrity

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- Have incident response procedures
- Regular incident response training
- Maintain incident response team
- Test incident response procedures

### Detection and Response
- Monitor for security incidents
- Implement automated incident detection
- Have procedures for incident containment
- Regular incident response drills

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Compliance
- Understand applicable regulations
- Implement compliance controls
- Regular compliance assessments
- Maintain compliance documentation

### Security Governance
- Establish security policies and procedures
- Regular security training for staff
- Security awareness programs
- Regular security assessments

## Configuration Management

### Secure Configuration
- Use secure default configurations
- Implement configuration management
- Regular configuration reviews
- Automated configuration validation

### Change Management
- Implement change control procedures
- Security review for all changes
- Test changes in secure environments
- Rollback procedures for security issues

## Vendor and Third-Party Security

### Vendor Assessment
- Assess vendor security practices
- Require security certifications
- Regular vendor security reviews
- Monitor vendor security incidents

### Third-Party Integration
- Secure third-party integrations
- Implement access controls for third parties
- Monitor third-party access
- Regular third-party security assessments

## Continuous Improvement

### Security Metrics
- Track security metrics and KPIs
- Regular security assessments
- Benchmark against industry standards
- Continuous security improvement

### Training and Awareness
- Regular security training for all staff
- Security awareness programs
- Phishing simulation exercises
- Security culture development
