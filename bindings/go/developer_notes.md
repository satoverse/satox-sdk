## Notes
- Follow Go idioms and best practices
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Use standard `testing` package for tests
- Ensure quantum and security modules are robust
- Maintain feature parity with other language bindings
- All managers include thread-safe locking with sync.RWMutex
- Proper error handling and validation throughout
- Configuration management for all managers
- Initialization state tracking for all managers

## Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive unit tests for all managers
2. Add integration tests for cross-manager operations
3. Create example applications demonstrating SDK usage
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Create documentation and tutorials
