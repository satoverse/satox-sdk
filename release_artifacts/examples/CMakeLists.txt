# Satox Core SDK - Root Examples File

# This file is a placeholder.
# Individual examples are defined within the CMakeLists.txt of each component
# in the src/ directory (e.g., src/core/examples/CMakeLists.txt).

# The root CMakeLists.txt will add the component directories,
# which will in turn add their own examples if they exist.
